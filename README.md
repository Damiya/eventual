# The Eventual PlayFramework-AngularJS-Bootstrap-MongoDB Seed Project

## Introduction

This **[CRUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)** seed project emerged from realizing the confusion the developersâ€™ community has over the hearty combination:
1) Play framework and MongoDB in the back-end.
2) AngularJS and Bootstrap in the front-end.

This seed aims at underpinning the development of future applications that adopt the mentioned combination.
